# AntiHaxerman
> An open-sourced anti-cheat solution for servers and for people to learn from.

## About

Keep in mind I coded this all whilst drunk as hell so you never know what you might find. - Tecnio

This is a project mostly designed for people to be able to learn and take code from (with proper credits hopefully) to use on their projects also while being fully usable on a production scale server.

## Warning

This project is intentionally nerfed in order to teach people not to mess up on whilst providing them the ground works of
a nice and robust anti-cheat base that they can work off of.

This by itself will work stably for the most part, but do not expect it to detect everything and by no means is it flawless.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Maven
- JDK 8+

### Installation
1. Clone the repository\
`git clone https://github.com/Tecnio/AntiHaxerman.git`
